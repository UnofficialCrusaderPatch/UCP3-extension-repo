  should &

  stop the AI from continuously demolishing and rebuilding buildings where no &

  access is available.'
ai_addattack: Increase of the rate of additional attack troops
ai_addattack_alt_descr: 'Alternatively, the additional troop count can be made dependent
  on the &

  troop count of the first attack. Since this value is different for each AI, &

  the following attacks will also scale, instead of increasing by the same value &

  for each AI lord.

  Example: Scale factor = 0.5

  Sultan''s attack troops = 10, 15, 20, 25, ...

  Saladin''s attack troops = 50, 75, 100, 125, ...'

  as well as sending them past other enemies'' castles to gather.'
ai_attackwave: Improve attack waves
ai_attackwave_descr: 'The AI in an attack in vanilla only sends as many troops at
  once as &

  there are wall parts reachable. This causes units to drop in in small waves &

  when the target castle has a lot of buildings directly at its walls.

  This option makes units also attack civil and fortification buildings, as &

  well as wall parts which are already being attacked by one unit. Moreover,

  the AI sends more troops to the enemy lord as soon as it detects a breach.'

  for it, leaving its production chains running dry. This option reduces the amount
  of time the AI waits for its stocks to be empty before restocking the necessary
  goods.
ai_tethers: Disable ox tether spam
ai_tethers_descr: 'Usually, the AI builds for each new stone quarry a new ox tether,
